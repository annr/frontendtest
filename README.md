# Check Your Web

https://frontendtest.com/ checks web pages and web apps for valid markup, broken links, a11y requirements, and web performance best practices...etc.

Note: this is an old, salvaged project written in PHP and it's still PHP.

### TODO

- replace homegrown link checking with https://validator.w3.org/checklink
- update all of app.js to use jQuery
- add small w3c icon to the Nu Validator results
- confirm requests to APIs break gracefully

### Rules to be added or improved:

- Add details about adding ARIA roles to suspicious class and ID name check
- add check for stale copyright year
- Explain how to add character encoding if it is missing
